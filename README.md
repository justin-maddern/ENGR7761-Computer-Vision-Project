# ENGR7761-Computer-Vision-Project
Repository for my ENGR7761 Computer Vision Project.
Project: Volleyball tracking and court line detection implemented using Hough circle and line Transforms through OpenCV.
## Layout
The code for implementation is in a Jupyter notebook and contains some of the other methods I explored within executing the project.
I have attached some of my own clips that were used for the project. 
Within the code you will have to change the names of the files you are putting through the VideoCapture as some file names will have changed.
## Note
Within the notebook there is one section that does not and is labelled as such.
